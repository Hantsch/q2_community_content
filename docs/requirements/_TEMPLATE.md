## Requirement

<What should be achieved and why? From the user's perspective. No solution — the "what", not
the "how".>

## Acceptance Criteria

<Numbered, so `## Acceptance Tests` below can point at each one individually. One
criterion = one observable fact, not a bundle of three.>

- [ ] **AC1** — <how do you recognise it is finished?>
- [ ] **AC2** — ...

## Open Questions

<Leave empty. Filled during refine (`/refine <id>`) if the requirement is still
unclear. Must be resolved before status goes to `ready`. Inside a sprint these are put to the
user in the clarification round.>

## Plan

<Leave empty. Filled by `/refine <id>`: a short, precise overview — max. ~50 lines.
Concrete steps, affected files, order. No essay.>

## Deliverables

<Leave empty. Filled by `/refine <id>`: small pieces, each with its own acceptance
(scrum-like) and the files it touches. `/build` implements them in order, in one go.
Every acceptance criterion above must be covered by at least one deliverable **and** by the
test named for it in `## Acceptance Tests` — the test is part of the deliverable that
implements the behaviour, never a clean-up afterwards. Refine checks both before
`status: ready`, build refuses to start without them.>

- [ ] D1 — <smallest useful, individually acceptable result; names the files it touches>
- [ ] D2 — ...

## Model Hints

<Agent tier per deliverable. Default is the cheap tier with `/build`'s effort — leave
unmarked. If a step needs more brainpower: "D3 (balancing formula) → deliverable-hard" (Opus +
high effort, agent in `.claude/agents/`) plus a one-sentence risk justification.
Plus one line for the code review, default: "Review: → default".>

## Acceptance Tests

<Leave empty. Filled by `/refine <id>`: one line per acceptance criterion above, naming the
automated test that proves it — level, file, and the test name it will carry. The tests are
written by the deliverables, not afterwards; `/build` re-checks this mapping and that the
tests pass before `status: done`. This section replaces the manual test plan: acceptance is
the suite, not a click list.

- AC1 → e2e `tests/e2e/<flow>.spec.ts` › "<test name>" (real surface, per
  `ui-acceptance-required`)
- AC2 → unit `tests/core/<module>.test.ts` › "<test name>"
- AC3 → **manual residue:** <the real reason it cannot be automated — an OS dialog, a
  specific machine, a paid external service>. Goes into the sprint review; blocks nothing.>

## Done

<Leave empty. Filled by `/build <id>` after implementation:
- Short summary (2–5 lines): what was done.
- Commit message (1–2 lines, keywords are enough).
- Verification: build/test/lint result + review outcome; open points/blockers, if any.>
